# Collect User Feedback & take screenshot automatically

When users submit feedback about a web application, it's useful
to see a screenshot of the page they're providing feedback about.


This code will take a picture of the *dom* (like a screenshot) and
send it, along with text feedback to a location of your choice.

- Useful for getting actionable feedback from users who wish to send it
